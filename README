    Linear C++

A C++ tutorial that can (hopefully?) be followed without jumping from chapter to
chapter at every step.

Download at: https://github.com/jesyspa/linear-cpp/archive/master.zip

Via a bash shell, compiling all chapters:

    for a in Chapter*; do g++ -std=c++11 -o "$a/out" "$a"/*.cpp; done

If you're on OS X, you should probably get clang with XCode instead; in that
case, the above command should use clang++ instead of g++.

Also, when compiling your own files on either of those two platforms, I
recommend you add -Wall and -Wextra to your flags.  Clang users may also want to
add -fsanitize=undefined .

Future chapters plan:
Near future - Exceptions, Templates
Later - Classes, Operator Overloading, RAII, Pointers
Unplaced - Casting, Scope, Storage Duration, Undefined Behaviour,
           Volatile, Metaprogramming, Unions and Variants, Boost, C++14,
           File IO, Optional
Appendices - Declaration Syntax, Pointers to Members, Switch, The Preprocessor

Other plans:
 - More specific IDE setup instructions
 - Compiling advice
 - Script to generate Makefiles and MSVC projects for each chapter
 - Exercises!
 - Generating more human-readable files from the tutorials (or the other way
   around?)
